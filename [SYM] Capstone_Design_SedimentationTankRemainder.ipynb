    "* Add an introduction explaining the problem that you are solving. The goal is to design a sed tank that can be used in many communities. \n",
    "* Define the problem and explain how you will solve it.\n",
    "* Set this up for working in Python. Define the constants that you already know. You can look in the expert inputs file (see the mathcad source files linked below) to see if there are any other constraints you are missing for the sed tank.\n",

    "We don't have a minimum depth of the sed tank. Instead you add up the required depths for each of the components to get the total depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator can't give the intended dimensions of the tank. Your design will provide those dimensions. \n",
    "Influent turbidity might be interesting, but we don't currently have a way to use that to improve the sed tank design. Remember that a water treatment plant must be able to treat water with a very wide range of contaminant concentrations.\n",

    "I've [zipped the Mathcad code](http://designserver.cee.cornell.edu/aguaclaracode/AguaClaraCodeCompact.zip) for your use. Try the SedTank.xmcd inside the ADT designs. I believe you can use mathcad in computers in Carpenter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next submission you will want to have the majority of the sed tank designed. This is a significant challenge. The AIDE team can help specify what level of detail they need to be able to draw the sed tank."
