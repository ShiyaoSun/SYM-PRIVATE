    "Congratulations on making it this far! Although we haven't designed every component in the sedimentation tank, you have a good idea of the analysis that is required for systematic parametric design. We have not covered the topics of the inlet channel, the launder that removes clean water from the top of the sedimentation tank, the floc weir or floc hopper, or the system of equations used to calculate the final depth of the sedimentation tank. The detailed design required to create a high-performing sedimentation tank is sophisticated, complicated, and if you are successful the resulting sedimentation tank is high-performing and easy to maintain!"
